# Sorting Algorithms Educational Demo - Modular Structure

## Overview

This project has been refactored into a modular structure to make it easier for students to review and understand each component individually. Each sorting alg`orithm and major functionality is now in its own file.

## File Organization

### üìÅ Main Program

- **`SortingDemonstration.cs`** - Main program entry point and interactive menu system

### üìÅ Sorting Algorithm Demonstrations

- **`BubbleSortDemo.cs`** - Bubble Sort implementation with step-by-step visualization
- **`SelectionSortDemo.cs`** - Selection Sort implementation with step-by-step visualization
- **`InsertionSortDemo.cs`** - Insertion Sort implementation with step-by-step visualization
- **`QuickSortDemo.cs`** - Quick Sort implementation with step-by-step visualization

### ÔøΩ Analysis Modules

- **`PerformanceAnalyzer.cs`** - Performance testing and empirical analysis
- **`ComplexityAnalyzer.cs`** - Theoretical complexity analysis and insights

### üìÅ Project Files

## Educational Benefits of Modular Structure

1. **Focus on One Algorithm**: Students can study one sorting algorithm at a time without distractions
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a single responsibility
3. **Easy Comparison**: Students can open two algorithm files side-by-side to compare implementations
4. **Progressive Learning**: Start with simple algorithms (Bubble Sort) before moving to complex ones (Quick Sort)

## How to Use

### Running the Program

```bash
cd lab-3-sorting
dotnet run
```

### Studying Individual Algorithms

## Next Steps for Students

1. **Experiment**: Modify the algorithms to see how changes affect behavior
2. **Compare**: Run different algorithms on the same data
3. **Analyze**: Use the performance tools to understand scaling
4. **Extend**: Add new sorting algorithms using the same structure
5. **Apply**: Use the knowledge to choose algorithms for real projects
