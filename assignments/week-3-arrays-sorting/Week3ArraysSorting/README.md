# Assignment 2: Arrays & Sorting - Student Skeleton

## üìã Overview

This is your starting point for Assignment 2! The skeleton provides the basic structure so you can focus on implementing arrays, algorithms, and the core learning objectives.

## üóÇ Files Provided

### Core Implementation Files

- **`Program.cs`** - Main entry point with menu system (mostly complete)
- **`BoardGame.cs`** - Board game skeleton for Part A (needs implementation)
- **`BookCatalog.cs`** - Book catalog skeleton for Part B (needs implementation)

### Supporting Files

- **`Assignment2.csproj`** - .NET project file
- **`books.txt`** - Sample book data for testing

## üéØ Your Tasks

### Part A: Board Game (40 points)

**File to work on:** `BoardGame.cs`

**What to implement:**

1. **Choose your game:** Tic-Tac-Toe (3√ó3) OR Connect Four (6√ó7) or Something of your own
2. **Multi-dimensional array:** `char[,] board`
3. **Game features:**
   - Initialize and render board to console
   - Get and validate player moves
   - Update board state
   - Detect win/draw conditions
   - Allow replay without restarting

**TODO markers to follow:**

- Look for `// TODO:` comments
- Each major method has guidance on what to implement
- Start with `InitializeNewGame()` and `RenderBoard()`

### Part B: Book Catalog (60 points)

**File to work on:** `BookCatalog.cs`

**What to implement:**

1. **File loading:** Read `books.txt` and normalize titles
2. **Recursive sorting:** Choose QuickSort OR MergeSort (your implementation)
3. **2D indexing:** Build `int[,]` index for first two letters (26√ó26)
4. **Fast lookup:** Use index + binary search for O(1) + O(log k) performance

**TODO markers to follow:**

- Each step has detailed guidance
- Choose your sorting algorithm and document it
- Focus on the multi-dimensional indexing requirement

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Test the Skeleton

```bash
dotnet run
```

You should see the main menu with placeholder messages.

### 2. Choose Your Game (Part A)

Open `BoardGame.cs` and decide:

- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** Simpler logic, good for first attempt
- **Connect Four:** More challenging with gravity mechanics

### 3. Choose Your Sort Algorithm (Part B)

In `BookCatalog.cs`, decide:

- **QuickSort:** Generally faster, document your pivot strategy
- **MergeSort:** Guaranteed O(n log n), uses extra memory

### 4. Follow the TODO Comments

Each file has detailed TODO comments explaining:

- What to implement
- Why it's needed for the assignment
- Example code structure
- Requirements to meet

## üìù Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Order:

1. **Start with Part A** - get familiar with multi-dimensional arrays
2. **Implement basic board rendering** - see your array in action
3. **Add game logic gradually** - moves, validation, win detection
4. **Move to Part B** - file loading and normalization
5. **Implement your chosen sorting algorithm**
6. **Build the 2D index structure**
7. **Add lookup functionality**

### Testing Tips:

- Test each component as you build it
- Use the provided `books.txt` for initial testing
- Add debug output to see your algorithms working
- Test edge cases (empty input, invalid moves, etc.)

## üéì Learning Focus

### Part A Teaches:

- **Multi-dimensional arrays** - `char[,]` declaration and manipulation
- **Console I/O** - rendering grids and getting user input
- **Game state management** - tracking turns, detecting wins
- **Input validation** - handling invalid moves gracefully

### Part B Teaches:

- **Recursive algorithms** - implementing QuickSort or MergeSort from scratch
- **Multi-dimensional indexing** - using `int[,]` for performance optimization
- **String processing** - normalization and comparison
- **Binary search** - finding items in sorted ranges
- **File I/O** - reading and processing text files

## üîß Development Tips

### For BoardGame.cs:

- Start with a simple console display
- Test move validation thoroughly
- Keep game logic in small, focused methods
- Use descriptive variable names for clarity

### For BookCatalog.cs:

- Test file loading first (print loaded titles)
- Implement sorting on a small array first
- Verify your 2D index with debug output
- Test lookup with known titles from your file

### For Both:

- Add plenty of console output to see what's happening
- Handle errors gracefully (file not found, invalid input)
- Keep methods small and focused
- Comment your logic, especially algorithmic parts

## üìã Requirements Checklist

### Part A - Board Game

- [ ] Multi-dimensional array declared and used
- [ ] Clear console rendering of board
- [ ] Input validation for moves
- [ ] Win/draw detection logic
- [ ] Replay functionality
- [ ] Clean code structure and comments

### Part B - Book Catalog

- [ ] File loading with error handling
- [ ] Title normalization implemented
- [ ] Recursive sort algorithm (QuickSort OR MergeSort)
- [ ] 26√ó26 multi-dimensional index built correctly
- [ ] Fast lookup using index + binary search
- [ ] Helpful suggestions when no exact match
- [ ] CLI loop for interactive searching

## üéØ Success Criteria

**You'll know you're succeeding when:**

- Your board game is playable and fun
- Your sorting algorithm correctly orders the book list
- Your lookup finds books instantly in large datasets
- Your code is well-commented and easy to follow
- You can explain how your multi-dimensional arrays improve performance

## üÜò Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**

1. Read the TODO comments carefully - they contain implementation hints
2. Review the assignment outline for requirements clarity
3. Test individual methods in isolation
4. Use console output to debug your algorithms
5. Ask for help in class or office hours

**Common gotchas:**

- Multi-dimensional array syntax: `array[row, col]` not `array[row][col]`
- Keep original and normalized titles synchronized during sorting
- Initialize 2D index arrays properly (handle empty ranges)
- Binary search requires sorted data and proper bounds checking

---

**Good luck! Focus on one TODO at a time, test frequently, and remember that the learning is in the implementation process.**
