# Assignment 8: Spell Checker & Vocabulary Explorer - Implementation Notes

**Name:** [Your Name]

## HashSet Pattern Understanding

**How HashSet<T> operations work for spell checking:**
[Explain your understanding of how O(1) lookups, automatic uniqueness, and set-based categorization work together for efficient text analysis]

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge faced:**
[Describe the most difficult part of the assignment - was it text normalization, HashSet operations, or file I/O handling?]

**How you solved it:**
[Explain your solution approach and what helped you figure it out]

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand about HashSet operations, text processing, or case-insensitive comparisons?]

## Code Quality

**What you're most proud of in your implementation:**
[Highlight the best aspect of your code - maybe your normalization strategy, error handling, or efficient text analysis]

**What you would improve if you had more time:**
[Identify areas for potential improvement - perhaps better tokenization, more robust error handling, or additional features]

## Testing Approach

**How you tested your implementation:**
[Describe your overall testing strategy - how did you verify spell checking worked correctly?]

**Test scenarios you used:**
[List specific scenarios you tested, like mixed case words, punctuation handling, edge cases, etc.]

**Issues you discovered during testing:**
[Any bugs or problems you found and fixed during development]

## HashSet vs List Understanding

**When to use HashSet:**
[Explain when you would choose HashSet over List based on your experience]

**When to use List:**
[Explain when List is more appropriate than HashSet]

**Performance benefits observed:**
[Describe how O(1) lookups and automatic uniqueness helped your implementation]

## Real-World Applications

**How this relates to actual spell checkers:**
[Describe how your implementation connects to tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.]

**What you learned about text processing:**
[What insights did you gain about handling real-world text data and normalization?]

## Stretch Features
