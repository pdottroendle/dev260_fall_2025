Find all .cs files (name target)
13 ^.*\\.cs$ name
(Matches app.cs if loaded.)


Find items beginning with doc (both name or extension)
13 ^doc.* both
(E.g., document.pdf.)


Match extension only (include directories = no)
13 ^\\.mp3$ extension n
(Finds song.mp3.)


Include directories and match names starting with P
13 ^P.* name y
(Will include Pictures/ if present.)



note : hadto escape backslashes in regex when typing in code, but in console input typed them normally (e.g., ^app.*\.cs$).


# Assignment 9: BST File System Navigator

## 📚 Overview

Build a **BST File System Navigator** that demonstrates the power of Binary Search Trees for efficient file organization, searching, and management!

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Core Classes

The assignment includes these key components:

- **`FileSystemBST`** - Main class with BST operations and file management (you implement 8 core methods + helper methods)
- **`FileSystemNavigator`** - Interactive menu system and user interface (provided)
- **`FileNode`** - File/directory data model with metadata (provided)
- **`TreeNode`** - BST node structure containing FileNode data (provided)

### Data Structures

```csharp
// Core file system storage with custom ordering
private TreeNode? root;

// File system collections for analysis
List<FileNode> allFiles = new List<FileNode>();        // All files during traversal
HashSet<string> uniqueExtensions = new HashSet<string>(); // File type tracking
Dictionary<string, int> extensionCounts = new Dictionary<string, int>(); // Analytics
```

### Key Operations

1. **Create Files/Directories**: Insert into BST with proper ordering
2. **Search Files**: O(log n) lookup by name with recursive navigation
3. **Filter Operations**: Tree traversal with extension/size/date filtering
4. **Aggregate Analysis**: Calculate totals and statistics through traversal
5. **Complex Deletion**: Remove nodes while maintaining BST structure

## 🎯 Implementation Requirements

You will need to implement **8 key methods** in the `FileSystemBST` class:

### File Management Methods

- `CreateFile(string path, long size)` - Insert files into BST with metadata
- `CreateDirectory(string path)` - Insert directories with proper ordering
- `DeleteItem(string fileName)` - Complex BST deletion with structure maintenance

### Search & Query Methods

- `FindFile(string fileName)` - O(log n) file lookup with recursive search
- `FindFilesByExtension(string extension)` - Filter files by type during traversal
- `FindFilesBySize(long minSize, long maxSize)` - Range queries with size bounds

### Analysis & Reporting Methods

- `FindLargestFiles(int count)` - Top-N analysis combining traversal + sorting
- `CalculateTotalSize()` - Aggregate calculation through recursive tree traversal

_All UI components, menu system, and data models are provided - focus on these BST operations!_

## 📝 Detailed Requirements

### 1. File System Creation Logic

- **BST Insertion**: Use recursive insertion maintaining file/directory ordering
- **Path Processing**: Extract file names and validate path format
- **Metadata Handling**: Set file size, extension, creation dates properly
- **Custom Comparison**: Directories before files, then alphabetical ordering

### 2. Search and Navigation

- **Recursive Search**: Implement O(log n) file lookup using BST navigation
- **Filtering**: Tree traversal with condition checking for extensions/sizes
- **Range Queries**: Find files within size bounds using efficient traversal
- **Performance**: Leverage BST structure for fast operations vs linear search

### 3. File System Analysis

- **Tree Traversal**: In-order traversal collecting files matching criteria
- **Aggregation**: Recursive calculation of total sizes and statistics
- **Top-N Queries**: Combine traversal with sorting for largest file analysis
- **Complex Deletion**: Handle all three BST deletion cases properly

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

Your application must handle these scenarios:

### Basic Functionality Tests

1. Create files and directories with proper BST ordering
2. Search for files by exact name with case-insensitive matching
3. Filter files by extension returning sorted results
4. Calculate total file system size accurately

### File System Operations Tests

1. **Path Handling**: "/documents/file.txt" vs "file.txt" should work correctly
2. **Case Sensitivity**: "README.txt" and "readme.TXT" should be treated consistently
3. **File Types**: Mix of files (.txt, .cs, .jpg) and directories
4. **Size Analysis**: Range queries and largest file identification

### Edge Case Tests

1. Try to search for files in empty file system
2. Create files with duplicate names (should handle gracefully)
3. Delete non-existent files and verify tree structure maintained
4. Process very large file sizes and verify calculations
